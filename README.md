# Guess_My_Number

This is a simple JavaScript project called "Guess My Number." The game generates a random number between 1 and 20, and the player has to guess the number within a certain number of attempts. After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. The game ends when the player guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts. This project utilizes DOM manipulation to create an interactive and dynamic user experience.
